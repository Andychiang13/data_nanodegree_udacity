    "<br> From the OLS linear regression statistics, both retweet count and favorite count are correlated with timestamp and the slopes are statistically significant. However, the correlation coefficient R-squared is poor for retweet count (0.166) as compared with favorite count (0.432). Also, we could see more clearly in the graphs below showing that the favorite count tends to have a better correlation with the increasing of time. "
